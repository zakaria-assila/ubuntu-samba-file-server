# Overview

## What is this project?
This repository documents my Ubuntu Server lab where I deployed a Samba file server for a small-company scenario.

## Why Samba?
- Common in real IT environments for Windows-compatible file sharing (SMB/CIFS)
- Great practice for users/groups, permissions, and access control
- Strong portfolio project for system administration / system integration roles

## Scope
Included:
- Networking baseline (stable IP, connectivity)
- Users/groups + permissions
- Samba configuration + share access control
- Firewall and basic hardening
- Testing from a Windows client
- Logs and backup/restore

Excluded (future version):
- Active Directory domain integration
- High availability clustering
